/*
this problem is similar to Unique Paths. The introduction of obstacles only changes the boundary conditions and make some points unreachable (simply set to 0).

Denote the number of paths to arrive at point (i, j) to be P[i][j], the state equation is P[i][j] = P[i - 1][j] + P[i][j - 1] if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1 and 0 otherwise.

Now let's finish the boundary conditions. In the Unique Paths problem, we initialize P[0][j] = 1, P[i][0] = 1 for all valid i, j. Now, due to obstacles, some boundary points are no longer reachable and need to be initialized to 0. For example, if obstacleGrid is like [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], then the last three points are not reachable and need to be initialized to be 0. The result is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].
